Intelligent Customer Help Desk with Smart Document Understanding
Project Scope

Project Name:  Intelligent Customer Help Desk with Smart Document Understanding
Start Date:        18/05/2020


Project Summary:
The project revolves around the concept of a typical customer care chatbot can answer simple questions, such as store locations and hours, directions, and maybe even making appointments. When a question falls outside of the scope of the pre-determined question set, the option is typically to tell the customer the question is not valid or offer to speak to a real person.
In this project, there will be another option. If the customer question is about the operation of a device, the application shall pass the question onto Watson Discovery Service, which has been pre-loaded with the device’s owner’s manual.

Project Requirements:
The project requirements include, 
•	Creating a customer care dialog
•	Building an enhanced Watson Discovery collection
•	Creating an IBM Cloud Functions web action
•	Building a web application
•	Deploying the same on IBM Cloud Platform

Functional Requirements:
The functional requirements include,
•	A simple Chatbot
•	When a question falls outside of the scope of the pre-determined question set, the application shall pass the question onto Watson Discovery Service, which has been pre-loaded with the device’s owner’s manual
•	The project shall use the Smart Document Understanding feature of Watson Discovery to train it on what text in the owner’s manual is important and what is not. This will improve the answers returned from the queries
•	Integrating all features and building a web application and using IBM Cloud to deploy them

Technical Requirements:
The technical requirements include the following,
•	Making a simple functional Chatbot
•	Improving the functionality and instead of “Would you like to speak to a customer representative?” we can return relevant sections of the owner’s manual to help solve our customers’ problems
•	Building a web application and using IBM Cloud

Software Requirements:
The project will require the use of following software:
•	Python 3.7.4
•	PyCharm/Sublime Text
